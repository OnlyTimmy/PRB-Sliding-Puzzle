# Sliding Puzzle – C# Console Application

Console-based sliding puzzle game developed in C# with a strong focus on validation, structure, and clean code practices.

## Overview

This project started as a base assignment and was extended with additional validation logic and gameplay improvements.  
The focus was on writing structured, maintainable code rather than only achieving functional output.

## Architecture & Design

- Object-Oriented Design
- Clear separation between:
  - Map loading
  - Validation logic
  - Game logic
  - Rendering
- Defensive programming principles
- Explicit input validation before execution

## Core Features

- File-based map loading
- Dimension validation (min/max constraints)
- Character validation
- Single player enforcement
- Mandatory ice tile detection
- Console rendering system
- Player movement system

## Extended Features

- Custom start position support
- Board numbering logic
- Detection of isolated ice tiles
- Structured error feedback
- Improved validation flow and logic isolation

## Technical Stack

- C#
- .NET Console Application
- File I/O
- Structured validation pipeline

## Versioning Strategy

- `main` → Base implementation (v1.0)
- `uitbreiding` → Feature branch with extended validation (v1.1)

This project demonstrates incremental development and version control discipline using Git.
